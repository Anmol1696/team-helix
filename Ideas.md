# IDEAS for Hackathon

## 1. DEV ENVIRONMENT

A dev environment that simulates the production on your local as well as on kubernetes cluster. It'll 
help developers to:
1. test their application on scale
2. fork the mainnet and simulate the real chain
3. test their cross chain xApps


### Problem State
People trying to launch on any of the EVM based chains face various problems:
1. when they try to test on testnet because limited availability of tokens
2. testing of application on scale is also not possible testnet if it involves a lot of test tokens

### Solution

### Tech Stack to be used
Docker, Kubernetes, Eth Clients, Optimism Clients



## 2. Portfolio Tracking Website


## 3. ETF
